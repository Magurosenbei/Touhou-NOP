Manager
Standard Object Abstract
Point Object
Texture
Camera
GamePlay
Noise Generator

Resource Files --- This you can change the ico file, draw anything you want >.< just don't touch the code file in it

Other Places that are best left untouched:

Source Files


------------------------------------------

Things that inherits singleton please use the class name :: Instance() instead of new operator
It is best if variables of the item is a pointer
eg. Player * P1;
	P1 = &Player :: GetInstance();	// this is to convert the instance returned as a pointer to fit in
	
All Sprites / Texture must be created via Resource Manager (Gobal) to prevent PF usage from getting too high.
To get Time details, use the Time Frame Manager (Gobal)

*************************************
Things need to fixed:
Interface class			(Fix Selection, X button and character selection, SFX of selection for mouse and keyboard)
Audio Engine			(cannot replace segments and seems to have to do in main)

To Be Done:
WeatherSystem			--	throw out acceleration vector, link up with all objects
Stage					--	"Wrapper kind of thing" new filter
Bullet Wave				--	"New class" With list + release capability to prevent memo leak
Separate Stage Process	--	do in engine.cpp
HUD						--	do in interface, have to have wind direction indication/ symbols and font
WeaponScripts			--	Complete another 2 weapon
Point Objects			--  finish up quickly (requires another list depending on situation)
Font					--	Fix this as quickly as possible
Enemy/Boss				--	High Pirority
GamePlay System			--	finish up script and such


Completed:
Win Api				
Noise Generator		
Engine				
	
Texture				(Fixed)
Audio Engine		(Needs fixes)	
Vector Mathematics	
In-Game Mouse		
Player				(Reimu and Marisa Character Definiation Completed)
